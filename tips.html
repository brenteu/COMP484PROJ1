        <p>
          Proper gear makes all the difference. Beginners should rent equipment
          before buying to test different setups. Intermediate riders may want
          to invest in their own board and boots tailored to their riding style.

          Warm up before riding, check slope conditions, and always follow
          resort rules. In the backcountry, carry avalanche gear (beacon, probe,
          shovel) and ride with a partner trained in avalanche rescue.

        <p>
          Snowboarding requires core strength, leg endurance, and flexibility.
          Off-season training like squats, balance exercises, and yoga can
          significantly improve performance and reduce injury risk.

        <h2>Season Preparation</h2>
        <p>
          Preparing before winter makes your first days on the slopes more
          enjoyable and safer. Off-season training—such as squats, lunges, and
          balance work— keeps your legs and core strong. Stretching or yoga
          improves flexibility and reduces the risk of strains.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before heading out, check your gear: make sure bindings are tightened,
          boots fit properly, and outerwear is waterproof. Mental preparation
          matters too— set small goals for your first rides and build up
          gradually as your confidence grows.
