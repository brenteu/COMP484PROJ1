        <p>
          Snowboarding is a winter sport where riders descend snowy slopes using
          a single board attached to their feet. Born in the 1960s as a mix of
          surfing, skateboarding, and skiing, it has grown into a global
          phenomenon with millions of enthusiasts worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you're drawn to freestyle tricks, carving groomers, or
          exploring untouched backcountry powder, snowboarding offers a unique
          blend of athleticism, creativity, and fun.

        <p>
          The first snowboards were homemade “snurfers” — wooden boards without
          bindings. Over time, innovators added edges, bindings, and new shapes
          that allowed for carving, tricks, and jumps. By the 1990s,
          snowboarding was exploding in popularity and became part of mainstream
          winter sports.
        </p>
        <p>
          Snowboarding debuted at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, and since
          then, riders have continued pushing boundaries with new tricks, bigger
          jumps, and creative terrain use.

          Snowboarding competitions showcase the sport's progression and bring
          riders from around the world together. The <strong>X Games</strong>,
          established in the 1990s, became one of the most important stages for
          freestyle snowboarding, highlighting big air, slopestyle, and halfpipe
          events.
        </p>
        <p>
          Snowboarding entered the <strong>Winter Olympics</strong> in 1998,
          cementing its place as a global sport. Today, events like the
          <strong>Dew Tour</strong> and
          <strong>Natural Selection Tour</strong> continue to push creativity
          and progression, from urban-inspired park setups to backcountry
          freestyle contests.
        </p>
        <p>
          These competitions not only test skill but also inspire new
          generations of riders by broadcasting snowboarding's most innovative
          tricks and styles to a worldwide audience.
