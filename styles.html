        <h2>Choosing the Right Style for You</h2>
        <p>
          Every snowboarder finds their niche. Beginners often start with
          <strong>groomed runs</strong> to practice control and build
          confidence. Freestyle riders thrive in <strong>terrain parks</strong>,
          where rails and jumps test creativity and balance. Backcountry riders
          seek untouched powder, but this style requires avalanche training,
          safety gear, and strong physical endurance.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you progress, experiment with different terrains to discover what
          excites you most. Many riders mix styles—switching from carving on
          groomers one day to chasing powder or practicing tricks the next.
